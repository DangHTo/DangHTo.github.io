# About Me
Recently graduated Virginia Tech Computer Science Major Dang To!  My favorite thing about programming is that there is a visible improvement in code as you optimize it more and more.  It is fun improving your code and slowly becoming a better developer as you tackle more difficult problems and projects; in fact, it reminds me a lot of piano which is another rewarding hobby of mine.  Not only does programming improve yourself though, it's also great to see open source projects, games, media, APIs, etc. that have a tangible effect on all developers and people.  I really like that aspect of programming and that's why I want to become a better developer.

# My Projects

### PianoGuitar

It's a piano!  But also, it only plays guitar strings?  This project is just a simple musical application which allows users to play on their keyboard as they would play on a real piano keyboard.  The sound, however, is a guitar string which is mapped to each individual piano key.  I chose guitar strings because I wanted to try writing reverberation into my sounds and that is what this project has.

### WeatherApp

Very simple weather app that I created to test my skills in android development.  Has all the features that you'd expect from a mobile weather app!  Including: Real-time Database updates on weather every 10 minutes, Persistent storage of your starred cities, various information that is easy to access with one button press!

### Digital Music Player(Android)

A music player made in android studio with the Kotlin language.  Has a couple of songs and a couple of sound effects which you can choose to place anywhere in the song.  Kind of like a customizer of sorts.  Features to import sound effects and music will be added soon.

### Password Cracker(Python)

Uses a user-supplied file which contains keywords that would be used in a password.  From then, uses a dictionary based attack which tries to crack a password.  Also tests how much time the SHA256 and SHA512 hashing algorithms slow down the process with the use of Python graphs.
