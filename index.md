# About Me
Recently graduated Virginia Tech Computer Science Major Dang To!  My favorite thing about programming is that there is a visible improvement in code as you optimize it more and more.  It is fun improving your code and slowly becoming a better developer as you tackle more difficult problems and projects; in fact, it reminds me a lot of piano which is another rewarding hobby of mine.  Not only does programming improve yourself though, it's also great to see open source projects, games, media, APIs, etc. that have a tangible effect on all developers and people.  I really like that aspect of programming and that's why I want to become a better developer.

# My Projects
### PianoGuitar
It's a piano!  But also, it only plays guitar strings?  This project is just a simple musical application which allows users to play on their keyboard as they would play on a real piano keyboard.  The sound, however, is a guitar string which is mapped to each individual piano key.  I chose guitar strings because I wanted to try writing reverberation into my sounds and that is what this project has.
