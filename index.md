# About Me
Recently graduated Virginia Tech Computer Science Major Dang To!  My favorite thing about programming is that there is a visible improvement in code as you optimize it more and more.  It is fun improving your code and slowly becoming a better developer as you tackle more difficult problems and projects; in fact, it reminds me a lot of piano which is another rewarding hobby of mine.  Not only does programming improve yourself though, it's also great to see open source projects, games, media, APIs, etc. that have a tangible effect on all developers and people.  I really like that aspect of programming and that's why I want to become a better developer.

As for Computer Science, it really is amazing that there can be so much that is unknown when the computer was man-made concept. For me, Computer Science helped me understand how big of a scope there is to explore and how to analyze everything I'm writing to the computer.
